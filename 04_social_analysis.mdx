## **Why It Helps to Study Other Creators**

The creator economy is big, but it’s also connected. Watching what other creators are doing can help you:

- Spot what’s resonating with audiences right now
- Discover content formats that might work for you
- See where there might be gaps in your space that you can fill
- Understand how people are packaging and positioning similar ideas

You’re not here to be a copy of anyone else. You’re here to be _you_ — but it never hurts to study the field.

## **How to Do a Simple Creator Analysis**

Here’s a framework to help you explore creators in your niche:

### **1. Find 5 to 10 creators who share a similar audience or vibe**

You don’t need to pick the biggest names. In fact, smaller creators with solid engagement often provide the clearest signals. Look for people whose content feels adjacent to yours — not identical.

### **2. Study what they’re posting**

Pay attention to their content types. Are they posting short videos? Long-form breakdowns? Carousels or photo dumps?

Also look at tone and frequency. Are they posting daily? Are they funny, serious, motivational?

### **3. Notice what gets engagement**

Which posts have high likes, comments, or shares? What are people responding to most? This tells you what their audience (and potentially yours) finds valuable.

### **4. Check where they’re active**

You might discover that some creators in your space are doing surprisingly well on platforms you hadn’t considered, like LinkedIn, Tumblr, or even Pinterest.

### **5. Look for gaps**

Do you see content they’re _not_ covering? Do you notice a perspective you wish someone was offering? That could be your opportunity to bring something new.

## **Some Tools to Help (Optional)**

You can go deep using tools like:

- [Social Blade ](https://socialblade.com/)(free) to track follower growth and post performance
- [**Later**](https://later.com/) or [**HypeAuditor**](https://hypeauditor.com/) for Instagram and TikTok content research
- **Manual tracking** via a simple spreadsheet to compare post types and engagement

But honestly, you don’t need fancy tools to get started. A few hours of intentional scrolling can tell you a lot.

## **What To Do With What You Find**

Once you’ve collected some insights:

- **Take note of what resonates**, and ask yourself how you could apply a similar format or energy to your own brand
- **Find your edge** — what’s the unique value or voice _you_ can bring to the space?
- **Avoid copying** — the goal is to learn from others, not blend into the feed. There will definitely be cross-overs in style and content. But if you integrate your personal brand/story into it, it can really seperate your content from others.

Your content should still sound and feel like you. Always.

## **Final Thoughts**

Learning from other creators is one of the smartest things you can do when starting out. It gives you real-world perspective, helps you avoid common pitfalls, and sparks ideas that can shape your own strategy.

You’re not competing with them — you’re joining the conversation in your own way.

In the next resource, we’ll dig into content pillars — the themes and topics that keep your brand consistent, clear, and fun to create for.
