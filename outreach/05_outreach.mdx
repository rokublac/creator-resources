## **Sending Your Outreach**

When you’re ready to send your pitch, make sure you’re doing it from a clean, professional email address. Ideally, this means avoiding emails like _yourname1998@gmail.com_ or anything that might feel too casual or personal. If possible, use a custom domain email, like **hello@yourname.com** or **contact@yourbrand.co**.

This simple shift makes a big difference. Custom domains make you look more credible, established, and intentional — especially when reaching out to marketing professionals and brand managers who see hundreds of emails a week.

Setting one up is easier than you think. You can register a domain with services like [**Namecheap**](https://www.namecheap.com/) (domains) and [**Google Workspace**](https://workspace.google.com/) (business email). You will have to pay a fee for these services so it's perfectly fine to do this later when you feel more comfortable.

  If you’re not ready for that yet, no stress — just keep your email handle clean, clear, and free of anything unprofessional. You can always upgrade later when you’re ready to scale your brand outreach.

## **Following Up Without Feeling Pushy**

Following up is a normal, expected part of the process — in fact, it’s often where the magic happens. Brand managers are busy. Emails get buried. A gentle, thoughtful nudge can make all the difference.

Here’s a general cadence we recommend:

- **First follow-up**: About one week after your initial pitch
- **Second follow-up**: Three to four weeks after your first follow-up
- **Optional third follow-up**: Only if it’s timely — like if a seasonal campaign is approaching or if the brand just announced a new product you can align with

Each follow-up should be short, kind, and add value. You might highlight a recent piece of content that performed well, or gently remind them why you think the partnership could be a good fit.

Avoid guilt-tripping, sounding frustrated, or using phrases like “just following up again” on repeat. Instead, try something like:

> “Hi [Name], just wanted to quickly circle back on my last email. I’m still really excited about the possibility of collaborating with [Brand] and have a few new content ideas I’d love to share if it’s a good time.”

## **When You Get Ghosted (and You Will)**

Let’s be real — not every pitch will get a reply. And that’s okay. It’s not personal, it’s just part of how the game works.

Brands have internal timelines, shifting budgets, rotating staff, and inboxes that are constantly overflowing. A no-response isn’t always a “no forever.” It might just be a “not right now.”

Don’t let silence discourage you. Come back to that brand a few months later when you’ve launched a new content series or when your audience has grown. Timing matters — and so does showing up with persistence and grace.

## **Staying Organized**

As your brand list grows, so will your outreach efforts — which is why it’s important to keep everything organized. You can effectively manage your brand outreach using tools like:

- **Airtable**: A spreadsheet-meets-database tool that’s perfect for CRM-style tracking.
- **Notion**: Great for custom boards and databases. You can track brands, contact info, follow-up dates, and responses.
- **Google Sheets**: Simple but effective for logging pitches, follow-up notes, and scheduling future outreach.
- **Todoist or Trello**: Ideal for creators who like simple to-do lists or Kanban-style organization.

We’ll provide a few template options you can plug into your favorite system to start tracking your outreach in minutes.

## **Final Thoughts**

Pitching is rarely a one-and-done thing. It’s an ongoing part of your creator journey — and the most successful creators are the ones who treat it as a process, not a pressure.

You’ll send emails. Some will be ignored. Some will lead to great conversations. Some will pay off months later. It’s all part of building relationships, building trust, and building something that lasts.

Alright, so we’ve covered the key steps to really make the most of your brand partnerships as a creator. Just remember — if you want to succeed in influencer marketing, it takes more than just posting. You need a solid plan, smart research, and genuine effort to build strong, lasting relationships with the brands you love.

Best of luck on your journey to scoring meaningful and exciting collaborations. You’ve got this\!
