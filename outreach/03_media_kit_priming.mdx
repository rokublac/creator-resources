description: "Now that you’ve done the research and narrowed down brands that feel aligned, it’s time to prepare something that speaks on your behalf — your media kit. But a great media kit is just one part of the puzzle. The other part? Making sure your public-facing content and social presence are aligned with the kind of brands you want to attract."

## **What’s a Media Kit, Really?**

At its core, a media kit is a polished digital document or page that includes key details about you as a creator. It should give brands a clear understanding of your content, your reach, your values, and the type of collaboration you’re looking for.

It typically includes:

- A short bio and profile photo
- Links to your most active platforms
- Up-to-date audience and performance stats (like follower count, reach, engagement rate)
- A breakdown of what you offer (sponsored posts, reviews, video integration, etc.)
- Past brand collaborations or testimonials (if you have them)

It doesn’t need to be long or flashy — it just needs to be clear, professional, and easy to skim.

### **Recommended Tools and Templates**

You don’t have to build your media kit from scratch. There are some great tools out there that make the process simple and clean:

- [**Beacons**](https://beacons.ai/i/app-pages/media-kit) offers a free **Live Media Kit** builder, which auto-updates with real-time follower stats across Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. It’s highly recommended for creators who want a link-in-bio style solution.

## **Priming Your Social Media Profiles**

Your media kit is what you _send_ to brands — but your social media profile is what they’ll _check_ first. That’s why this lesson also covers how to **prime your presence** so it works hand-in-hand with your media kit.

Here’s how you can do that:

- **Audit your bio**. Make sure your profile makes it clear what kind of content you create and who it’s for. This isn’t just for your audience — it’s for brand reps too.
- **Pin relevant posts**. Showcase your best work or previous brand collabs at the top of your profile. Pinning a product review or well-performing video can be just as powerful as stats in your kit.
- **Tag brands authentically**. If you already use products from your dream brands, share content using them and tag the brand. You don’t need permission — it’s content you’re already making. This puts you on their radar in a low-pressure, organic way. This can be a simply mention, or a full product review for them. Whatever it is, have it fit your personal brand and make it authentic.
- **Stay consistent with your themes**. Make sure your content aligns with your niche and the types of brands you want to work with. If you’re aiming for wellness brands, but your feed is all memes, there’s a mismatch that could be hurting your chances. 

### **Why This Matters**

The combination of a strong media kit and a dialed-in public profile is what makes you brand-ready. It helps you show up with confidence, professionalism, and clarity — and that’s what makes you memorable to the people reviewing dozens of creators a week.

Even if you’re just starting out, investing the time to build a clean, on-brand presence will set you apart. It’s not about pretending to be someone you’re not — it’s about clearly showing who you are and why that matters to the right brands.

## **Final Thoughts**

Your media kit is more than just a PDF — it’s a reflection of how you show up in the creator world. Paired with a polished, thoughtful online presence, it becomes one of your most powerful assets in building brand partnerships.
