This isn’t just about writing down brands you think are cool. It’s about intentionally identifying the companies that align with your content, your values, and your audience. A good brand list is the foundation of successful outreach — it helps you stay focused, pitch with purpose, and avoid wasting time on partnerships that don’t feel like a good fit

So let’s dive into how to build yours\!

## **Start With Brands You Genuinely Love**

Your brand list should start with what you already know and trust. Think about the products or services you already use in your daily life. What’s in your home, your bag, your workspace? What have you shared naturally on social media without even realizing it?

When you pitch to brands you genuinely love, it comes through in your content and your messaging. It’s more authentic, easier to create around, and more likely to build into a lasting relationship.

## **Don’t Be Afraid of Big Brands**

This is important, so let’s pause here.

**Just because a brand is big doesn’t mean they’re out of reach.**

In fact, a lot of major brands _want_ to work with micro-influencers and creators who are just starting out. Why? Because they have budget. They have systems. And more often than not, they’re open to testing partnerships with creators who bring a strong voice, clear values, and a niche audience — even if it’s small.

Big brands often have **more flexibility** to experiment. They run dozens, sometimes hundreds, of partnerships per quarter, and they know that real influence isn’t always about follower count — it’s about audiencce connection.

So don’t rule them out. If anything, reach out to both smaller niche brands _and_ well-known names. You might be surprised which ones say yes first.

## **Take Notes from Other Creators**

One of the easiest ways to discover potential brand partners is by observing what’s happening around you. Check out creators in your niche or adjacent niches and take note of who they’re partnering with.

If a brand has already worked with someone similar to you, that’s a good signal they’re open to creator collaborations. You can often find brand partnerships through hashtags, YouTube descriptions, Instagram tags, and even LinkedIn job boards (many brands now post “Creator Partnerships” or “Community Manager” roles).

Just be sure to avoid copying someone else’s entire list — instead, look for brands that make sense for _you_ and your content style.

  At Creobase we have one of the largest creator collaborations databases for this exact purpose. We recommend you to [explore our collaborations](https://www.creobase.com/collaborations) to help give you more clarity on how specific brands work with creators.

## **Think Seasonally and Thematically**

Struggling to come up with ideas? Try planning your brand list based on themes or seasons. For example, in the lead-up to summer, you might highlight brands that align with travel, wellness, or outdoor content. Around holidays, look for gifting brands or those running seasonal campaigns.

<Tip>
  You can do keyword searches like "Christmas", "Black Friday", "Summer" in our [collaboration database](https://www.creobase.com/collaborations) to narrow down your search.

This approach not only helps you plan content that fits current trends, but it also makes your outreach more timely and relevant — which increases your chances of getting a reply.

## **Track Everything in One Place**

Once you start identifying brands you’d love to work with, it’s important to stay organized.

A simple spreadsheet in **Google Sheets**, a table in **Notion**, or even a basic **Airtable base** can be a great way to track your list. You can include columns like:

- Brand name
- Website and social links
- Why you want to work with them
- Contact info (if you find some, but this can be left empty at this stage)
- Whether you’ve pitched yet (for later)
- Status of the outreach (for later)

If you’re into more granular control, tools like [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/), [**Trello**](https://trello.com/), or even [**Streak CRM for Gmail**](https://www.streak.com/) can help manage your outreach like a pipeline.

The point is: don’t rely on memory or a dumpy ground of unstructured notes. The more structure you give this, the easier everything else becomes — especially as your list grows

## **What to Aim For**

Start with a list of 10 to 15 brands. That’s a manageable number and gives you a great foundation for your brand list. Also, you don't need to have all 10-15 brands be the perfect fit. For example, you can pick 5 brands that you think fits perfectly with your perosna brand and have the rest be secondary. Update your list every month with notes about trends, launches, or partnership about the brand, remove brands that are no longer a good fit and add fresh opportunities that you see fit.

Remember, your brand list is a living document. Keep nurturing it, researching, and refreshing it as you go.

## **Final Thoughts**

Building your brand list is where the whole process begins — and when done right, it saves you time, helps you stay focused, and increases your chances of landing meaningful partnerships.

It’s okay if you don’t have all the answers right now. The point is to start with brands that feel aligned and give yourself a simple, repeatable process to follow.

In the next lesson, we’ll take things a step further and show you how to find **the right contacts** at those brands, plus how to do quick, effective research that makes your outreach 10x more personal.
