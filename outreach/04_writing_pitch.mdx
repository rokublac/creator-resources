## **Why Your Pitch Email Matters**

Your pitch is your introduction — it’s your chance to make a meaningful first impression and show the brand why you’re worth paying attention to.

But brands get hundreds of messages every week, and many of them are vague, copy-pasted, or clearly not tailored. That’s your opportunity. A well-crafted, personal, clear pitch stands out more than a big follower count ever could.

That’s what we’ll walk through here — the strategy behind a great pitch email, the tone that works best, and the key elements that should be included.

## **What Makes a Great Pitch Email?**

Let’s break it down. Almost every solid pitch includes the following elements:

### **1. A warm, personal intro**

Start by greeting the recipient by name, and introduce yourself in a simple, friendly sentence. Let them know who you are, what you do, and the kind of content you create. Keep it casual but clear — this isn’t a LinkedIn bio.

> Hi Sarah,
>
> My name is Kai. I’m a digital designer by day and content creator by night, and I share weekly tips to help creatives streamline their workflow and grow online.

### **2. A connection to the brand**

Next, show that this isn’t a mass email. Mention how you found the brand, why it stands out to you, or how it fits into your current content plans. If you already use the product or have talked about it before, say so — it builds trust.

> I’ve been using your planner app for over a year, and it’s become a staple in my productivity setup. In fact, I’ve already featured it in two of my weekly setup videos — both of which performed above average.

### **3. What you’re planning**

Let the brand know what you’re working on — whether it’s a themed content series, a product review lineup, or a specific campaign idea. Help them visualize how your content and their product or service could come together.

> I’m currently planning a back-to-school series for August, and I’d love to include your brand as one of my recommended tools for students and creatives.

### **4. Stats and proof**

Include a few relevant metrics to back up your credibility. This could be average views, engagement rates, audience demographics, or a link to your media kit. You don’t need to overshare — just a few numbers to give context.

> My content currently reaches around 85,000 viewers each month, with an average engagement rate of 8.4% on Reels and 12.7% on TikTok. My audience is primarily Gen Z and Millennial creatives across the US and UK.

### **5. A clear, respectful ask**

Be specific. Are you asking to collaborate? To discuss a partnership? To send over more ideas? Make your CTA friendly and non-pushy.

> Would you be open to chatting about a potential collaboration? I’ve included a few content ideas below to give you a sense of what it might look like.

### **6. Optional: Concept teasers**

Including a couple of creative video or post ideas that show your thinking can really help. Brands love to see initiative — and it gives them a preview of what it would be like to work with you.

## **Tone Tips**

- Keep your tone conversational and human. Write like you speak — clear, confident, but not overly formal.
- Avoid buzzwords and jargon. Don’t call yourself a “digital engagement architect” unless you want to get ignored.
- Don’t oversell. Confidence is great, but be real. Be you.
- Make it about them, not just you. Yes, you’re pitching yourself, but make it clear that this is about **how you can add value** to the brand, not just what you want from them.

## **What If You’re Just Starting Out?**

If you’re a newer creator or a micro-influencer and don’t yet have big numbers to share, that’s completely okay. Seriously — don’t let it hold you back.

Brands don’t just look at follower count. In fact, more than ever, they care about **authenticity, alignment, and engagement**. Many brands love working with smaller creators because:

- You often have tighter-knit communities
- Your content tends to feel more organic and trustworthy
- You’re easier to collaborate with and open to creative flexibility

Instead of leading with numbers, lead with your voice, your message, and your audience connection. You can highlight things like:

- Strong engagement (even if it’s just a few consistent commenters or DMs)
- Quality of content and storytelling
- Relevant themes or niche focus that fits the brand perfectly
- Recent organic mentions of the brand, or similar content that performed well

Here’s a simple line you could use in your pitch if you’re still growing:

> While my following is still small, I have a highly engaged and loyal audience. My recent posts on [topic] have sparked a lot of interaction, and I believe [brand] would really resonate with them.

The truth is, you don’t have to be “big” to get started. You just have to be **intentional** and **aligned**.

And the more pitches you send, the better you’ll get — and the more confident you’ll feel.

## **Templates to Make It Easier [in progress]**

We know writing from scratch can be hard, especially at first. That’s why we’ve included several pitch templates below for different situations:

  If you’ve never pitched before, start with the brand you’re most excited about. It’s easier to write a pitch when you genuinely love the product — and your passion will come through.

## **Final Thoughts**

We know these pitch emails can feel a little stiff — maybe even a bit too formal or business-y. And that’s totally valid. Email outreach is, by nature, a professional channel. Brands are used to receiving hundreds of messages, so this format is designed to help you cut through the noise in a way that’s clear, respectful, and direct.

But here’s something important to remember: the outreach is only one part of the story.

Everything you’ve done up until this point matters just as much — if not more. Crafting your personal brand voice, building a thoughtful media kit, researching the brand, and even priming your account by tagging brands you already use or creating organic content around them… all of that is part of the outreach too.

When a brand gets your email, they’ll likely check your profile. That’s where they’ll feel the _real you_ — the content, the vibe, the voice, the values. The email just opens the door. Everything else you’ve created is what encourages them to walk through it.

So if the email part feels a bit cold or stiff, know that it doesn’t have to be the _only_ expression of your personality. It’s just the container. What makes it powerful is everything you’ve done leading up to it — and how you show up once the conversation starts.

In the next lesson, we’ll focus on keeping the momentum going. You’ll learn how to send and track your outreach like a pro, follow up without feeling pushy, and manage your growing list of contacts with clarity and confidence.
