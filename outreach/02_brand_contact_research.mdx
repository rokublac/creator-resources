## **Get to Know the Brand Before You Reach Out**

Before you ever send an email or DM, you should have a strong sense of who the brand is and what they’ve been up to lately.

Here are a few ways to get that information:

- **Visit our brands section on** [**Creobase**](http://creobase.com/brands). Even if you’re not on our premium plan yet, you can still explore brand profiles, assess what sort of contacts they have, visit their social pages, and get a feel for what types of creators they’ve worked with in the past (if we have past collaborations with them). This alone can give you great context for your outreach system.

  <Tip>
    We recommend new creators use our monthly diverse set of free brands first before subscribing. This help you develop your system, rhythm, and builds your confidence.
  </Tip>
- **Check their recent Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn activity**. What kind of content are they posting? Are they pushing a new product, running a seasonal campaign, or talking about partnerships? Look for clues that suggest their current goals and messaging.
- **Look at past collaborations**. Are they working with creators like you? Are they leaning into short-form video, storytelling, aesthetic reels, educational breakdowns? This gives you insight into the kind of content they value — and how you can bring something fresh to the table.

  <Info>
    An easy way to do this, is search the brand name in our [collaborations database](https://creobase.com/collaborations). This will bring up any collaborations we have with them.

- **Simply Google the brand and check the news**. This is a quick way to see if they’ve been in the media recently. Maybe they raised funding, launched a new line, entered a new market, or announced a collab. Also it's a quick way to maybe also filter out brands you _don't_ want to work with depending on what news you find.

## **Look for Signals and Themes**

As you’re exploring, you want to go beyond surface-level info. You’re looking for trends. Is this a brand that’s very community-driven? Do they care about sustainability? Are they clearly focused on Gen Z, or are they leaning into lifestyle storytelling?

The more tuned in you are, the more tailored your outreach will be — and that increases your chances of getting a response.

## **Final Thoughts**

Research isn’t just a formality — it’s your edge.

Spending just 10 to 15 minutes digging into a brand’s recent activity, partnerships, and priorities can completely shift how your outreach is received. It shows that you’re thoughtful, aligned, and serious about being a collaborator — not just another cold outreach in their inbox.

But here’s the thing. Outreach is only one part of the equation. In the next lesson, we’ll explore how to **set yourself up to attract brands organically**, even before you pitch. You’ll learn how to prime your personal brand, create a powerful media kit, and start showing up on a brand’s radar through small but intentional actions — like tagging them in content you already love, posting genuine product reviews, and aligning your vibe with their aesthetic.

Because sometimes, the best partnerships start before you even hit send.
